##About
I am assisting [Dr. Kelley](http://patrickgagekelley.com/) with this research. The topic of the research is Android permissions.
The goal is to help Android users make better(safer) choices when choosing to install a Android application by carefully presenting useful
information about that apps permissions.

We want to show the user that there is no reason a wallpaper app should need permission to access phone calls by giving a graphic of average
permissions for that search.
